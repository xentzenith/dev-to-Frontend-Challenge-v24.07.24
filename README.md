_This is a submission for [Frontend Challenge v24.07.24](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend-2024-07-24), Glam Up My Markup: Recreation_

## What I Built

**For this challenge, I created a landing page for the New York Recreational Cricket League. The goal was to design a modern, user-friendly interface that effectively communicates the league’s offerings and engages potential members. The page features:**

**A Header:** Showcases the league’s name and a call-to-action button for contacting us.
**A Navigation Bar:** Provides smooth navigation between different sections of the page.


**Main Sections:**
- About the League: Details about the league and its benefits.
- Location of Games: Information on where games are held and how to get there.
- Season Schedule: Highlights important dates and events for the upcoming season.
- Membership Info Dialog: A modal with detailed membership options and benefits, accessible from a button within the “About” section.

## Journey
**Process and Learning**

- Design & Development: I used Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach to create a responsive and visually appealing layout. I aimed for a modern design with a focus on usability and accessibility.
- Dialog Implementation: Implemented a modal dialog for membership information that pops up when a button is clicked, enhancing user engagement.
- Page Transitions: Added smooth transitions between sections to provide a seamless user experience.
- Loading Animation: Included a loading animation that fades out after a short delay to enhance perceived performance.
**Challenges & Solutions**

- Navbar Overlap with Dialog: Ensured that the dialog does not interfere with the navbar by using z-index effectively.
- Responsive Design: Tested the layout on various screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
- What I'm Proud Of
- Interactive Features: The modal dialog and dynamic section transitions provide an interactive experience.
- Responsive Layout: The site looks great on both desktop and mobile devices, thanks to Tailwind CSS.
